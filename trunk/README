GMforecast is a small XML reader for gismeteo.com. It is written in TCL and uses TDOM as XML parser. 
It is simple, but allows you just watch the weather without pain.

Currently CLI (Command Line Inetface) version og GMforecast is almost finished, it can satisfy 
newbie user needs. So the main goal is development is different GUI versions lyke screenlets or so.
